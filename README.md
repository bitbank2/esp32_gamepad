<br>

The purpose of this code is to easily connect to SteelSeries:Free gamepads
using bluetooth RFCOMM. These gamepads are one of a very limited number that
support a non-HID communication mode which makes it easier for software to
directly communicate with them.<br>

Features:<br>
---------<br>
- Scan for nearby devices and return the bluetooth address if found<br>
- Callback function tells you when controller buttons/sticks have changed<br>
- Simple to write code to make use of the control info<br>
- Works on all ESP32 systems<br>
- Designed to be used in the Arduino IDE<br> 
<br>
See the example sketch for how to use the library.
